## Motivations

It's too damn hard to motivate yourself (and maintain persistent passion for learning) to do something new, break current boundaries of knowledge, so I've come up with idea that it's nice to have something like diaries-notes about what new has been learnt during a day

## Format

For now it's just a simple notes with interesting stuffs per day
